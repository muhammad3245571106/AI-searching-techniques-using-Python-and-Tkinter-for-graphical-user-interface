# AI-searching-techniques-using-Tkinter-and-python-with-graphical-interface
This is a Python project that uses Tkinter to develop the front end of the application and Python to implement AI searches. This has a cool graphical interface and visualization to make the project look aesthetic.
I've implemented all of these searches named below.
### Uninformed Search
* Breadth-First Search
* Depth First Search
* Depth Limited
* Iterative Deepening
* Uniform Cost Search
* Bidirectional Search
### Informed Search
* Best First Search
* A* Search
### Adversarial Search
* Simulated Annealing
* Alpha Beta Pruning
